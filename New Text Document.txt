I am a keen developer, hardworking, dedicated and I love to learn. I am extremely interested in your projects and technologies and would like to work for you. I always try to seek learning opportunities and try too learn from them. Though my academic grades are low, I try my best to compensate on that using my practical knowledge and you can always test me on that. I am not a parrot to mug up things, I prefer to reflect that on my work. My skillset humbly boasts of Software Development using JAVA, PYTHON, C++.


   More importantly, an internship would be mutually beneficial. Your company has an excellent reputation , and I know that the combination of my experience, skill, education, hard work and motivation to excel will make me an asset to your development team.

  It would be an honour for me to work with,  if opportunities are given and I would try my best to give my 110% performance.

  I have attached my CV, it would be my greatest honour if you kindly enumerate it and provide me an internship assessing my skillsets, not my CGPA.

I would want a room, some snacks, a coffee, a pillow, some loud music on my headphones..and I will be off in my world, working  my hearts out. And a next day long sleep would be fine .:)
